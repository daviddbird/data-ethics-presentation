Data ethics presentation - Should there be a mandatory code of conduct for all Data Scientists?

Unlike lawyers, accountants, medics or actuaries, there is currently no requirement for data scientists to hold any 
specific qualification or industry membership. There is rising awareness of the harmful power of data, and a number 
voluntary codes of conduct have been developed.

As part of the CodeClan Data Analysis course I had been asked to consider how data scientists should be accredited 
and if a code of conduct were implemented, what the key features of this should be and present this back to the 
class as a 15 minute presentation using R markdown and styled using CSS.
