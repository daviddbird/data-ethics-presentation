## Data ethics presentation - Should there be a mandatory code of conduct for all Data Scientists?

### Introduction
Unlike lawyers, accountants, medics or actuaries, there is currently no 
requirement for data scientists to hold any specific qualification or industry 
membership. There is rising awareness of the harmful power of data, and a number 
voluntary codes of conduct have been developed.

As part of [CodeClan's](https://codeclan.com) Data Analysis course in Edinburgh, 
I was asked to consider how data scientists should be accredited and if a code 
of conduct were implemented, what the key features of this should be and present
this back to the class as a 15 minute presentation using slides created in R 
markdown and styled using CSS.
